# Traffic-Sign-Classification-using-TensorFlow-Keras
The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. We cordially invite researchers from relevant fields to participate: The competition is designed to allow for participation without special domain knowledge. 

Our benchmark has the following properties:  
1. Single-image, multi-class classification problem 
2. More than 40 classes 
3. More than 50,000 images in total 
4. Large, lifelike database
